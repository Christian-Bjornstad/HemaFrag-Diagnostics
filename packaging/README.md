# HemaFrag Diagnostics — Desktop Packaging

HemaFrag is packaged as a **native PyQt desktop app** on all supported platforms.
The canonical packaged entrypoint is `qt_app.py`.

The embedded/local Panel server is now treated as legacy support only:
- it is not the default packaged startup path
- packaged builds disable it by default via a runtime hook
- it can still be re-enabled explicitly with `HEMAFRAG_ENABLE_LEGACY_PANEL=1`

## Supported Release Outputs

Every platform is built from the same desktop packaging contract in `build_qt.py`.

Artifacts:
- macOS: `dist/HemaFrag.app` and `dist/releases/HemaFrag_macOS.zip`
- Linux: `dist/HemaFrag_Linux` and `dist/releases/HemaFrag_Linux_offline.zip`
- Windows: `dist/HemaFrag_Windows` and `dist/releases/HemaFrag_Windows.zip`

## Platform Targets

### macOS
- Native `.app` bundle
- Includes `qt.conf` post-build fix for macOS translocation compatibility

### Linux
- Primary target: **offline Fedora 35 x86_64 machine**
- Runtime assumption: **glibc 2.31 or newer**
- Desktop startup forces **`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`**
- Offline bundle includes critical XCB/Qt runtime libraries inside the artifact

### Windows
- Native desktop bundle with `HemaFrag.exe`
- Same packaged app behavior as macOS/Linux

For the hospital/work-computer deployment where a new packaged executable is
not allowed, run the source tree with the approved Python 3.14 environment and
the installed `fraggler-kernels` wheel.  A Windows shortcut with the HemaFrag
icon can be created without installing or distributing another executable:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File packaging\create_windows_shortcut.ps1 `
  -PythonPath "C:\path\to\approved-python-3.14\python.exe"
```

The shortcut points to that existing Python interpreter, launches `qt_app.py`,
uses the repository as its working directory, and uses `assets/app_icon.ico`.
The app also sets a stable Windows AppUserModelID before Qt starts, so a source
launch uses the HemaFrag taskbar identity instead of the generic Python group.

## Quick Start

### Build macOS
```bash
cd /path/to/OUS
./packaging/build_mac.sh
```

### Build Linux Offline Bundle
```bash
cd /path/to/OUS
./packaging/build_linux.sh
```

### Build Windows on Windows
```cmd
packaging\build_windows.bat
```

### Build Windows via Docker
```bash
cd /path/to/OUS
./packaging/build_windows.sh
```

Build-tool reproducibility:
- `packaging/build-requirements.txt` pins the packaging toolchain separately from runtime dependencies.
- The wrapper scripts and Docker build images install both `requirements.txt` and `packaging/build-requirements.txt`.
- Full CI/release automation is still out of scope; artifact launch validation remains a manual release check.

## Linux Offline Deployment

Use `dist/releases/HemaFrag_Linux_offline.zip`.

Target machine:
- Fedora 35
- x86_64
- offline supported

Run on Linux:
```bash
unzip HemaFrag_Linux_offline.zip -d ~/HemaFrag
cd ~/HemaFrag/HemaFrag_Linux
chmod +x HemaFrag
./HemaFrag
```

Validation checklist:
```bash
ldd --version
ldd ./HemaFrag
```

Expected:
- glibc 2.31+
- no unresolved bundled XCB/Qt runtime dependencies

## Release Uploads

Recommended GitHub release assets:
- `HemaFrag_macOS.zip`
- `HemaFrag_Linux_offline.zip`
- `HemaFrag_Windows.zip`

## Troubleshooting

### The old icon still appears on Windows

1. Confirm the title bar and Alt-Tab entry show HemaFrag while the app is open.
2. Unpin only the old HemaFrag/Python shortcut, close the app, then start it
   from the newly generated shortcut and pin that running HemaFrag window.
3. Confirm the shortcut's **Properties → Change Icon** path points to the
   current `assets\app_icon.ico`.

Windows can cache a pinned shortcut's old icon even when the running Qt window
is correct.  Do not delete the global Windows icon cache or unrelated pinned
items as a first troubleshooting step.

### Linux launch fails with missing library errors
- Ensure the full zip was extracted, including `_internal`
- Run `ldd ./HemaFrag`
- Keep the offline bundle contents together; do not move the binary out of the folder

### Linux opens with Wayland/X11 issues
HemaFrag forces `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb` in packaged Linux builds for compatibility.

### macOS unsigned app warning
Use right-click → `Open` the first time, or sign/notarize the zip before release.

### Windows or Linux build size is large
Expected. The bundle includes Python, scientific libraries, Qt, and packaged assets.
